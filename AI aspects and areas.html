	<h2> AI areas</h2>
<p> AI is the ability of a machine to display human-like capabilities such as reasoning, learning, planning and creativity. AI enables technical systems to perceive their environment, deal with what they perceive, solve problems and act to achieve a specific goal.   </p>
<p> AI-Powered Assistants
Virtual shopping assistants and chatbots help improve the user experience while shopping online. Natural Language Processing is used to make the conversation sound as human and personal as possible. Moreover, these assistants can have real-time engagement with your customers. Did you know that on amazon.com, soon, customer service could be handled by chatbots?

Fraud Prevention
Credit card frauds and fake reviews are two of the most significant issues that E-Commerce companies deal with. By considering the usage patterns, AI can help reduce the possibility of credit card fraud taking place. Many customers prefer to buy a product or service based on customer reviews. AI can help identify and handle fake reviews. 

2. Applications Of Artificial Intelligence in Education
Although the education sector is the one most influenced by humans, Artificial Intelligence has slowly begun to seep its roots into the education sector as well. Even in the education sector, this slow transition of Artificial Intelligence has helped increase productivity among faculties and helped them concentrate more on students than office or administration work.

Some of these applications in this sector include:

Administrative Tasks Automated to Aid Educators
Artificial Intelligence can help educators with non-educational tasks like task-related duties like facilitating and automating personalized messages to students, back-office tasks like grading paperwork, arranging and facilitating parent and guardian interactions, routine issue feedback facilitating, managing enrollment, courses, and HR-related topics. 

Creating Smart Content
Digitization of content like video lectures, conferences, and textbook guides can be made using Artificial Intelligence. We can apply different interfaces like animations and learning content through customization for students from different grades. 

Artificial Intelligence helps create a rich learning experience by generating and providing audio and video summaries and integral lesson plans.

Voice Assistants
Without even the direct involvement of the lecturer or the teacher, a student can access extra learning material or assistance through Voice Assistants. Through this, printing costs of temporary handbooks and also provide answers to very common questions easily.

Personalized Learning
Using top AI technologies, hyper-personalization techniques can be used to monitor studentsâ€™ data thoroughly, and habits, lesson plans, reminders, study guides, flash notes, frequency or revision, etc., can be easily generated.

3. Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Lifestyle
Artificial Intelligence has a lot of influence on our lifestyle. Let us discuss a few of them.

Autonomous Vehicles
Automobile manufacturing companies like Toyota, Audi, Volvo, and Tesla use machine learning to train computers to think and evolve like humans when it comes to driving in any environment and object detection to avoid accidents.

Spam Filters
The email that we use in our day-to-day lives has AI that filters out spam emails sending them to spam or trash folders, letting us see the filtered content only. The popular email provider, Gmail, has managed to reach a filtration capacity of approximately 99.9%.

Facial Recognition
Our favorite devices like our phones, laptops, and PCs use facial recognition techniques by using face filters to detect and identify in order to provide secure access. Apart from personal usage, facial recognition is a widely used Artificial Intelligence application even in high security-related areas in several industries.

Recommendation System
Various platforms that we use in our daily lives like e-commerce, entertainment websites, social media, video sharing platforms, like youtube, etc., all use the recommendation system to get user data and provide customized recommendations to users to increase engagement. This is a very widely used Artificial Intelligence application in almost all industries.

4. Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Navigation
Based on research from MIT, GPS technology can provide users with accurate, timely, and detailed information to improve safety. The technology uses a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks and Graph Neural Networks, which makes lives easier for users by automatically detecting the number of lanes and road types behind obstructions on the roads. AI is heavily used by Uber and many logistics companies to improve operational efficiency, analyze road traffic, and optimize routes.

5. Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Robotics
Robotics is another field where Artificial Intelligence applications are commonly used. Robots powered by AI use real-time updates to sense obstacles in its path and pre-plan its journey instantly. 

It can be used for:

Carrying goods in hospitals, factories, and warehouses
Cleaning offices and large equipment
Inventory management</p>
