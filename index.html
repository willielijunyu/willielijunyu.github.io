	<p> I was born in Guinea in March 12, 2009. I came to Shenzhen after three weeks, and moved back to Africa at the age of 3. I went to United Kingdom. From then, I went back to Guinea when I was eight. When I was ten, I came to Shenzhen and studied in a public school. three years later, I came to BBSZ, which is the best school on this planet currently.</p>
\
<p> After that, I met my true friend, who named Andy Guo, who is a suoer nice person with a big face and cute short hair. He is also a good student, who has a GPA of 4.0, which is a bit lower then me.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Andy is a absolute failure of chasing love. As his friend, I often comfort him by saying "Though your grade are fantastic", what a poor guy.</p>
